# Morley Search Engine & Cloud Database Platform

© 2026 Morley Moses Apooch. All Rights Reserved. See `LICENSE.md`.

A fully functional, dependency-free full-text search engine with an
embedded document database and a web front end — runs anywhere Node.js
runs, with no `npm install` step and no external services required.

```

## Running it

```bash
node backend/server.js
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** — search box on top, an "Add a
document" admin panel below it.

## REST API

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Engine + database stats |
| GET | `/api/documents` | List all indexed documents |
| POST | `/api/documents` | `{ title, content, url? }` → index a document |
| DELETE | `/api/documents/:id` | Remove a document |
| GET | `/api/search?q=...&limit=10` | Ranked full-text search |
| GET | `/api/suggest?q=...` | Prefix ("type-ahead") term suggestions |

## How the search engine works

1. **Tokenizer** — lowercases, strips punctuation/accents, drops stop words.
2. **Inverted index** — `term → { docId: termFrequency }`, built in `search-engine.js`.
3. **Ranking** — TF-IDF: term frequency (normalized by document length) ×
   inverse document frequency, summed per query term, sorted descending.
4. **Type-ahead** — a character trie built alongside the index for prefix lookups.

## How the database works

`MorleyDB` is a small, collection-based document store (`db.js`) — think
"Mongo/Firestore in a single file." Each collection persists to a JSON
file under `data/`, supports schema validation, secondary indexes, and
CRUD. It is a genuine, working database — not a placeholder — but it is
sized for a single instance, not distributed/multi-region traffic.

## Scaling this to "all platforms" cloud infrastructure

This project runs as-is on any platform with Node.js 18+: Windows, macOS,
Linux, Docker, or serverless containers. To go from "single-instance" to
managed multi-region cloud infrastructure, the pieces to swap are:

| Component | Here (works today) | Swap-in for scale |
|---|---|---|
| Database | `backend/db.js` (JSON files) | PostgreSQL, MongoDB Atlas, DynamoDB, Firestore |
| Search index | `backend/search-engine.js` (in-memory) | Elasticsearch / OpenSearch / Postgres full-text |
| Server | Node `http` core module | Same code behind Nginx + PM2, or a container on Render/Fly.io/Railway/AWS |
| Front end | Static `index.html` | Same file served via any CDN (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, S3+CloudFront) |

The API contract (`/api/search`, `/api/documents`) is written so that
swap doesn't require changing the front end.

## On copyright & formal registration

Every source file above carries an embedded copyright/ownership header
identifying Morley Moses Apooch as author and owner, per the notice in
`LICENSE.md`. That header — plus this repository's timestamped creation —
is useful *evidence* of authorship. It is **not** a government filing.
Formal copyright/trademark registration in Canada must be filed directly
with CIPO (Canadian Intellectual Property Office); no software or AI tool
can complete that filing on your behalf.
